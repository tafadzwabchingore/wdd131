                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Tafadzwa Chingore. I was born in Harare, Zimbabwe, which is also where I am currently living.
                    <br>  
                    I am currently working towards my Bachelor's degree in Web Development at BYU-I. 
                    <br>
                    I am a sales clerk and part time baby sitter. I like mountain hicking, playing puzzle games and I like to travel. 
                    I like learning new facts about different topics so chances of finding me reading and watching educational videos 
                    on youtube in my spare time are high.</p>

                <p>Zimbabwe is a landlocked country in southern Africa known for its dramatic landscape and diverse wildlife, 
                    much of it within parks, reserves and safari areas. The name Zimbabwe is derived from the Shona words, 
                    dzimba dzemabwe, meaning houses of stone or stone buildings, symbolizing the Great Zimbabwe stone Ruins near 
                    the present day town of Masvingo.

            <p>Hello! My name is Tafadzwa Chingore. I am from Zimbabwe. I am the youngest child in a family of two. I want to become a Frontend Web Developer. 
            I am enjoy reading, mountain-hiking and puzzles. I love learning new things hence my passion for reading. My passion for hiking started when I 
            was invited by a friend to go mountain-hiking with her and some other mutual friends. Going up was hard but by after the hike I was looking 
            forward to doing it again and now I am always looking forward to more hiking trips. My greatest strength is determination. I believe with 
            God I can do anything, as long as I put effort and my mind to what I am doing. </p>
